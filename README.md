### üö® Troubleshooting Guide

1. Look at this week's [posted issues](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/inda-22/help/issues). Are other students asking about your problem?
2. If not, post a question yourself by creating a [New Issue](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/inda-22/help/issues/new). Add a descriptive title, beginning with "Task *x*: *summary of problem here*"
3. Ask a TA in person during the [weekly lab](https://queue.csc.kth.se/Queue/INDA). Check your schedule to see when the next lab is.

We encourage you to discuss with your course friends, but **do not share answers**!

### üèõ Assignment

#### Exercise 3.0 -- A Triangle Object
Create a new class called `Triangle.java` in the [src](src/) directory. 

The triangle class should have three fields of type `int` -- the sides `a`, `b` and `c`. Add a constructor that takes one parameter per side of the triangle, setting each sides' value to the corresponding parameter. 

The main method of the example below should compile if implemented correctly.

<details>
  <summary> üõ† Main method example </summary>

```Java
public static void main(String[] args){
  // create a new Triangle object with the sides 3, 1 and 1
  Triangle triangle = new Triangle(3, 1, 1);
}
```
</details>

#### Exercise 3.1 -- The Triangle Inequality
*The Triangle Inequality* is a popular theorem in mathematics. In simplified terms, it lets you know if three sides, *a*, *b*, and, *c*, can make a triangle. For example, if I give you *a = 3*, *b = 1* and *c = 1*, you can **not** make a triangle. An example of valid input is *a = 1*, *b = 1* and *c = 1*.

Create a method in the `Triangle` class with the following header `private boolean validTriangle(int a, int b, int c)`, that returns `true` if the parameters can construct the sides of a triangle, and `false` in all other cases.

A straightforward approach is checking if the three following relations are true. If they are, then the sides *a*, *b* and *c*, can make a triangle:

<img src="images/triangle-inequality.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

You should put the check at the top of your constructor and try the previous example again:

```Java
public Triangle(int a, int b, int c) {
  if(validTriangle(a, b, c)) {
    // Okay to create the Triangle object!
  } else {
    // End the program with an error message
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("This is not a valid triangle!");
  }
}
```

> **Assistant's Note:** There are various ways to achieve this. Under the [Wikipedia page for the Triangle Inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_inequality#Mathematical_expression_of_the_constraint_on_the_sides_of_a_triangle) there are some useful expressions you can use. Although it is not necessary, you may also use the [Java Math Library](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/beyondmath.html).

#### Exercise 3.2 -- The three types of Triangles

From the [Wikipedia page on Triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle) you can read about the three types of triangles. Make a method in the `Triangle` class called `String getTriangleType()` that returns a `String` of what type the triangle is (*"Equilateral"*, *"Isosceles"* or *"Scalene"*).

Equilateral Triangle             |  Isosceles Triangle | Scalene Triangle

> **From Wikipedia:** Hatch marks, also called tick marks, are used in diagrams of triangles and other geometric figures to identify sides of equal lengths. A side can be marked with a pattern of "ticks", short line segments in the form of tally marks; two sides have equal lengths if they are both marked with the same pattern.

#### Exercise 3.3 -- `Triangle.getArea()`
In this exercise, you have to calculate the area of a triangle. Mathematicans have come up with *many* formulas to achive this, but since our triangle object has the side lengths as fields, we recommend using [Heron's Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula). The formula states that the area of a triangle whose sides have lengths *a*, *b* and *c* is

<img src="images/herons-formula.png" alt="Heron's formula" width="400"/>

where *s* is the *semi-perimeter* of the triangle:

The method should be called `getArea()` and returns a `double`. Test your implementation before you push your solution to GitHub!

<summary> üìö How-to: square root (Java Math Library) </summary>
<! -- requires a blank space -->

In order to find the square root of an expression, you have to use the [Java Math library](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html). To take the square root of any number, you make the following call:

```Java
Math.sqrt(argument); // "argument" can be either a number, or an expression that evaluates to a number
```

</details>

> **Assistant's Note:** To use Heron's Formula you need the *semi-perimeter* *s*. We suggest you add a *helper method*, called `getPerimeter()`, to your Triangle class.

##### üí≠ Food for thought
An example of why one would use getters and setters to ensure encapsulation:

1. Create a triangle with the sides *a = 1*, *b = 1*, and, *c = 1*.
2. Change *a* from 1 to 3.
3. Do you still have a valid triangle?
4. How would you fix this?

You don't have to provide any answers, but it will be helpful to think about how to solve this with the code you already have.

#### Exercise 3.4 -- Reverse Engineering
Now that you have created a `Triangle` class, let's also create a `Rectangle` class along with some useful methods.

For this exercise, you will not be given detailed instructions. Instead, you will need to read trough the code in the [`src/RectangleExample`](src/RectangleExample) file. This code will attempt to create a `Rectangle` object and call three different methods on it. At the moment, it will not compile and run, since there is no `Rectangle.java` file, so start by creating this file in your [src](src) folder.

You will now need to create the fields, getters, setters and required methods in your `Rectangle` class that will allow `RectangleExample` to run and produce the correct results. Your code does not need to cover every edge case, but make sure to run the `RectangleExample` and check that your methods return the expected values. If you get stuck, don't hesitate to get help through any of the channels listed in the Troubleshooting section.
